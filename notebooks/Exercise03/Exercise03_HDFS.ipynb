    "## 1. The Hadoop Distributed File System\n",
    "### 1.1 &ndash; State which of the following statements are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The HDFS namespace is a hierarchy of files and directories: **True**\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. In HDFS, each block of the file is either 64 or 128 megabytes depending on the version and distribution of Hadoop in use, and this *cannot* be changed: **False**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A client wanting to write a file into HDFS, first contacts the NameNode, then sends the data to it. The NameNode will write the data into multiple DataNodes in a pipelined fashion: **False**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A DataNode may execute multiple application tasks for different clients concurrently: **True**\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. The cluster can have thousands of DataNodes and tens of thousands of HDFS clients per cluster: **True**\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. HDFS NameNodes keep the namespace both ~~RAM~~ in DRAM and on disk: **True**\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. The locations of block replicas are part of the persistent checkpoint that the NameNode stores in its ~~native~~ local file system: **False**\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. If the block size is set to 64 megabytes, storing a file of 80 megabytes will actually require 128 megabytes of physical memory (2 blocks of 64 megabytes each): **False**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, in contrast with the Object Storage logic model, HDFS is designed to handle a relatively small amount of huge files. A hierarchical file system can therefore be handled efficiently by a single NameNode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the default size is either 64 or 128 megabytes but this can be easily changed in the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the client writes data to the DataNodes. No data goes through the NameNode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, each DataNode may execute multiple application tasks concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, since each DataNode can execute multiple tasks concurrently, there may be more clients than DataNodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True, and an image of such namespace is also persisted on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the locations of block replicas may change over time and are not part of the persistent checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False, the size of the data file equals the actual length of the block and does not require extra space to round it up to the nominal block size as in traditional file systems. Therefore 80 megabytes will be stored as a block of 64 megabytes + a block of 16 megabytes."

    "As explained in the tutorials, to change HDFS configurations you edit `etc/hadoop/core-site.xml` and `etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml`. In the docker app, you can modify the variables in the `hadoop.env`. For example, in the following line,\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "# hadoop.env \n",
    "CORE_CONF_fs_defaultFS=hdfs://namenode:9000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`CORE_CONF` corresponds to `core-site.xml`. The second part `fs_defaultFS=hdfs://namenode:9000` will be transformed into:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<property>\n",
    "    <name>fs.defaultFS</name><\n",

    "For more details [see here](https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hadoop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Try changing the default block size of HDFS to see its affect on read & write performance. You can change the block size by modifying the follwoing line in `hadoop.env`: `HDFS_CONF_dfs_block_size=1048576` The value `1048576` determines the block size in bytes, which in this case is `2^20 bytes` or 1 megabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_NOTE:_** that for these configuration changes to take effect you must restart the docker app!\n",

    "1. Create a file with size ~150MB and uploade the file to HDFS. Check number of blocks via the Web interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each of the following block sizes 1048576, 134217728, measure the time to transfer from local to HDFS, from HDFS to local, and removing the file. \n",

    "You can run the following commands \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "time hadoop fs -copyFromLocal zeros.dat /myfolder/zeros.dat\n",
    "time hadoop fs -get /myfolder/zeros.dat zeros.dat\n",
    "time hadoop fs -rm /myfolder/zeros.dat\n",
    "```\n",
